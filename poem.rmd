## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Little Birds are dining  
Warily and well,  
Hid in mossy cell:  
Hid, I say, by waiters  
Gorgeous in their gaiters -  
I've a Tale to tell.  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In the hush of the morning, the leaves start to fall,  
A tapestry woven, a gold-tinged call.  
Crisp air wraps around, a gentle embrace,  
As sunlight dips low, painting shadows with grace.  

Pumpkins sit proudly on doorsteps aglow,  
While whispers of cider drift soft through the row.  
Chill in the breeze brings a shiver of change,  
Nature's bold palette, so vibrant, so strange.  

The crunch underfoot sings of stories untold,  
As time weaves a quilt of russet and gold.  
Clouds float like dreams in a sky brushed with fire,  
Each sunset a promise, each dusk a desire.  

Squirrels gather acorns, a feast to prepare,  
While children chase shadows in crisp, autumn air.  
With laughter like music, they dance ‘neath the trees,  
Chasing the whispers that ride on the breeze.  

The nights grow longer, stars twinkle like gold,  
Around crackling fires, warm tales will unfold.  
In the heart of the season, we find our own way,  
Embracing the magic that autumn will play.  

So gather the moments, let your spirit roam free,  
For in every fallen leaf, there’s a story to see.  
As the world wraps in amber, we’ll hold on tight,  
To the whispers of autumn that linger at night.
