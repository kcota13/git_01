In the hush of the morning, the leaves start to fall,  
A tapestry woven, a gold-tinged call.  
Crisp air wraps around, a gentle embrace,  
As sunlight dips low, painting shadows with grace.  

Pumpkins sit proudly on doorsteps aglow,  
While whispers of cider drift soft through the row.  
Chill in the breeze brings a shiver of change,  
Nature's bold palette, so vibrant, so strange.  

The crunch underfoot sings of stories untold,  
As time weaves a quilt of russet and gold.  
Clouds float like dreams in a sky brushed with fire,  
Each sunset a promise, each dusk a desire.  

Squirrels gather acorns, a feast to prepare,  
While children chase shadows in crisp, autumn air.  
With laughter like music, they dance ‘neath the trees,  
Chasing the whispers that ride on the breeze.  

The nights grow longer, stars twinkle like gold,  
Around crackling fires, warm tales will unfold.  
In the heart of the season, we find our own way,  
Embracing the magic that autumn will play.  

So gather the moments, let your spirit roam free,  
For in every fallen leaf, there’s a story to see.  
As the world wraps in amber, we’ll hold on tight,  
To the whispers of autumn that linger at night.
